I really enjoyed getting to better develop my skills in R this semester. It was also interesting getting to learn a little bit of the Python language. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that R and python can interact and both be used together in RStudio. Below are some examples of python code, and really simple instances of R and python interacting.
```{R}
library(reticulate)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/usr/bin/python/")
use_python("usr/bin/python")
```

```{R}
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
#this is a python code chunk
me_dict = {
'firstName': 'Casey',
'lastName': 'David',
'hobbies': ['playlist making', 'road trips', 'hiking', 'running'],
'age' : 22
}

print(me_dict)
```
This example was me creating a dictionary entry for myself with some information about myself. 
```{R}
#this is an R code chunk
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)

rough <- "This was a really interesting class."
```
My original intention was to cross these two (the above code and the below code), but was unable to get anything to work with reticulate. So I included the 'rough' variable in the python code down below and printed them out together. 
```{python}
rough = "This was a really interesting class."
time ="I learned a lot and got to work on my patience with technology."
print(rough, time)
```
