      <description>I really enjoyed getting to better develop my skills in R this semester. It was also interesting getting to learn a little bit of the Python language. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that R and python can interact and both be used together in RStudio. Below are some examples of python code, and really simple instances of R and python interacting.
library(reticulate) Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = &amp;quot;/usr/bin/python/&amp;quot;) use_python(&amp;quot;usr/bin/python&amp;quot;) #install.packages(&amp;quot;reticulate&amp;quot;) library(reticulate) #this is a python code chunk me_dict = { &amp;#39;firstName&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Casey&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;lastName&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;David&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hobbies&amp;#39;: [&amp;#39;playlist making&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;road trips&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hiking&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;running&amp;#39;], &amp;#39;age&amp;#39; : 22 } print(me_dict) ## {&amp;#39;lastName&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;David&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;age&amp;#39;: 22, &amp;#39;firstName&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Casey&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hobbies&amp;#39;: [&amp;#39;playlist making&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;road trips&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;hiking&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;running&amp;#39;]} This example was me creating a dictionary entry for myself with some information about myself.</description>

      <description>The dataset that I have chosen to use for this project is the ‘baseball’ dataset that is in the ‘vcd’ package. I chose this dataset because I have spent most of my life hearing my Dad and 2 older brothers talk about baseball; all three of them are able to rattle off random statistics from numerous years and numerous players. I thought this would be an interesting dataset to work with since I understand the game (and I thought it might help me earn some points with my family).</description>
